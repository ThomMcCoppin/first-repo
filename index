			<h1>The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis</h1>
		<p>
			Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plageuis the Wise?
			I thought not, its not a story the Jedi would tell you, its a sith legend. 
			Darth Plagueis was a sith lord so wise and powerful that he could influence the midi-chlorians to create life itself. 
			Eventually, he got so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which of course he did...
